# Electric_vehicle_data_analysis_SQL
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing 1,86,879 records related to electric vehicles, with key information like Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), registration details (county, city, state), vehicle type, electric range, MSRP, and more.
<br>
SQL was used to query and analyze data, providing valuable insights into the electric vehicle landscape based on various regional and performance factors.
<br>
This project extracts insights such as the total number of vehicles, their distribution by company, and detailed information like electric range and MSRP. The analysis includes advanced SQL techniques such as window functions, subqueries, and ranking. Specific queries retrieve vehicle data by criteria (e.g., Tesla models, vehicles with the highest MSRP), and categorize vehicles based on electric range. A view is also created to capture high-end vehicles with an MSRP of $50,000 or higher.
